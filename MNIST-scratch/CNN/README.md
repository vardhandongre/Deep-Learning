# Dataset:
MNIST database is a database of handwritten digits which contains 60,000 training
images and 10,000 testing images. The images are pre-processed to fit in 28X28 pixel box.
In this code the training images are stored in x_train and x_test and the corresponding
labels are in y_train and y_test respectively

# Model:
The network consists of convolution layer with multiple channels. In this model the Filter/Kernel
is 3X3 and the number of kernels is 5. The ReLU function is used which adds a layer of non-linearity.
