# Neural Network for MNIST dataset
Implementation of a neural network from scratch without any library in Python for the MNIST dataset. 
The neural network is trained on the Training Set using stochastic gradient descent and achieved 97.63% accuracy on the Test Set

# Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST dataset
Implementation of a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch). Implementation of convolution operation without any module. The convolution network has a single hidden layer with multiple channels. This model achieved an accuracy. This model is trained for 10 epochs using a Learning rate schedule with 0.01 as the beginning learning rate. The Learning rate is defined using a piecewise learning rate schedule which decreases from 0.01 to 0.00001.
