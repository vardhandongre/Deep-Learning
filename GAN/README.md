# Generative Adversarial Network
### (Source: Wikipedia)
In statistical classification, including machine learning, two main approaches are called the generative approach and the discriminative approach. These compute classifiers by different approaches, differing in the degree of statistical modelling.
1. A generative method attempts to model the full joint distribution P(X,Y). For classification problems, we want the posterior probability P(Y|X) which can be gotten from the modeled P(X,Y) with Bayes' Rule. In a similar fashion, we can also get the likelihood P(X|Y).
2. Generative models are useful for things like:
   * Representing and manipulating high dimensional probability distributions
   * Reinforcement learning applications where the model generates realistic experiences to learn from when acquiring data may      be costly.
   * Unsupervised/Semi-Supervised learning (acquiring unlabeled data is typically easier)
   * Capable of handling multi-modal models
